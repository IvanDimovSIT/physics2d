# 2D physics simulation
A 2D physics simulation made with macroquad for graphics and rayon for parallel calculations.

Add points with left click, click on points to make them static, drag lines between points to create a constraint, remove points with the middle mouse button, move points by draging them with the right mouse button.

Pause/unpause the simulation with space bar, show information with 'D' key.
